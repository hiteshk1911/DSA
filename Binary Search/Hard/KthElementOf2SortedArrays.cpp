Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays of size m and n respectively, you are tasked with finding the element that would be at the kth position of the final sorted array.

//Brute Force Approach
Time Complexity: O(m+n), where m and n are the sizes of the given arrays.
Reason: We traverse through both arrays linearly.

Space Complexity: O(m+n), where m and n are the sizes of the given arrays.

Reason: We are using an extra array of size (m+n) to solve this problem.

int kthElement(vector<int> &a, vector<int>& b, int m, int n, int k) {
                vector<int> arr3;

                //apply the merge step:
                int i = 0, j = 0;
                while (i < m && j < n) {
                    if (a[i] < b[j]) arr3.push_back(a[i++]);
                    else arr3.push_back(b[j++]);
                }

                //copy the left-out elements:
                while (i < m) arr3.push_back(a[i++]);
                while (j < n) arr3.push_back(b[j++]);
                return arr3[k - 1];
}

//Better Approach
Time Complexity: O(m+n), where m and n are the sizes of the given arrays.
Reason: We traverse through both arrays linearly.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.

int kthElement(vector<int> &a, vector<int>& b, int m, int n, int k) {
    int ele = -1;
    int cnt = 0; //counter
    //apply the merge step:
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < m && j < n) {
        if (a[i] < b[j]) {
            if (cnt == k - 1) ele = a[i];
            cnt++;
            i++;
        }
        else {
            if (cnt == k - 1) ele = b[j];
            cnt++;
            j++;
        }
    }

    //copy the left-out elements:
    while (i < m) {
        if (cnt == k - 1) ele = a[i];
        cnt++;
        i++;
    }
    while (j < n) {
        if (cnt == k - 1) ele = b[j];
        cnt++;
        j++;
    }
    return ele;
}

//Optimal Approach
Time Complexity: O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the sizes of two given arrays.
Reason: We are applying binary search on the range [max(0, k-n2), min(k, n1)]. The range length <= min(m, n).

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.

int kthElement(vector<int> &a, vector<int>& b, int m, int n, int k) {
    if (m > n) return kthElement(b, a, n, m, k);

    int left = k; //length of left half

    //apply binary search:
    int low = max(0, k - n), high = min(k, m);
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid1 = (low + high) >> 1;
        int mid2 = left - mid1;
        //calculate l1, l2, r1 and r2;
        int l1 = INT_MIN, l2 = INT_MIN;
        int r1 = INT_MAX, r2 = INT_MAX;
        if (mid1 < m) r1 = a[mid1];
        if (mid2 < n) r2 = b[mid2];
        if (mid1 - 1 >= 0) l1 = a[mid1 - 1];
        if (mid2 - 1 >= 0) l2 = b[mid2 - 1];

        if (l1 <= r2 && l2 <= r1) {
            return max(l1, l2);
        }

        //eliminate the halves:
        else if (l1 > r2) high = mid1 - 1;
        else low = mid1 + 1;
    }
    return 0; //dummy statement
