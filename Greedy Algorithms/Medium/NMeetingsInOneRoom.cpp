Problem Statement: There is one meeting room in a firm. You are given two arrays, start and end each of size N.For an index ‘i’, start[i] denotes the starting time of the ith meeting while end[i]  will denote the ending time of the ith meeting. Find the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated if only one meeting can happen in the room at a  particular time. Print the order in which these meetings will be performed.

Example:

Input:  N = 6,  start[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}, end[] =  {2,4,5,7,9,9}

Output: 1 2 4 5

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct meeting {
   int start;
   int end;
   int pos;
};

class Solution {
   public:
      //logic -> sort the meetings according to their end time
      bool static comparator(struct meeting m1, meeting m2) {
         if (m1.end < m2.end) return true;
         else if (m1.end > m2.end) return false; // if end time is same then sort according to their position
         else if (m1.pos < m2.pos) return true;
         return false;
      }
   void maxMeetings(int s[], int e[], int n) {
      struct meeting meet[n];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         meet[i].start = s[i], meet[i].end = e[i], meet[i].pos = i + 1;
      }

      sort(meet, meet + n, comparator);

      vector < int > answer;

      int limit = meet[0].end;
      answer.push_back(meet[0].pos);

      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
         if (meet[i].start > limit) {
            limit = meet[i].end;
            answer.push_back(meet[i].pos);
         }
      }
      cout<<"The order in which the meetings will be performed is "<<endl;
      for (int i = 0; i < answer.size(); i++) {
         cout << answer[i] << " ";
      }

   }

};
int main() {
   Solution obj;
   int n = 6;
   int start[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5};
   int end[] = {2,4,5,7,9,9};
   obj.maxMeetings(start, end, n);
   return 0;
}
Output:

The order in which the meetings will be performed is
1 2 4 5

Time Complexity: O(n) to iterate through every position and insert them in a data structure. O(n log n)  to sort the data structure in ascending order of end time. O(n)  to iterate through the positions and check which meeting can be performed.

Overall : O(n) +O(n log n) + O(n) ~O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)  since we used an additional data structure for storing the start time, end time, and meeting no.
